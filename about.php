 <p>Welcome to CoreDoctrine. If you are new to CoreDoctrine, or if this is your first time to the new and improved format, we have included some helpful information below to help you get acquainted with the site.</p>
 <p>Using the Cru Statement of Faith as a guide, CoreDoctrine is an interactive tool to give you an introduction to systematic theology while seeking to engage your heart to worship Christ and apply it in ministry.</p>
 <p>Once you log in, you’ll notice that each module is laced with video clips, audio clips, and questions along the way. And, you’ll notice that some of the questions are flagged for follow-up with your coach. The key to CoreDoctrine is that it is designed to be experienced with assistance from a mentor, or coach. Your coach will be able to track your progress and see your answers to any of your flagged questions or notes throughout CoreDoctrine.  You can then dialogue with your coach over these questions and notes.</p>
 <p>All of your answers and any of your notes will always be available for you in the “My Work” section.  So, be sure to check back there often to see your progress and check out all that you’ve been learning. </p>
 <p>But if you are not yet interested in jumping in with both feet and registering with CoreDoctrine, you can have a sneak peak into the first module and check it out as a guest user. Simply click the link to the right and you’ll be able to look at the content of Module 1 and the resource and blog pages.  But, if you want to answer any of the questions or comment on any blog posts, you’ll need to become a registered user.</p>
 
 <p>Thanks for using CoreDoctrine and feel free to email us with any questions or suggestions:<br>
