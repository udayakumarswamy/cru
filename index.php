          <div class="col-md-10">Why is doctrine important? Why spend the time seeking to know, love, and defend the doctrinal pillars of the faith? This module will challenge you to embrace a sound and working understanding of the faith. Basically, you will consider the “how’s and why’s” of doctrine along with considering how to distinguish between convictions, opinions, and persuasions.<br>

How do those in your sphere of influence view it? In this module, you will be considering one of the most important questions related to our faith…is God’s Word truly trustworthy in our pursuit of truth? And, how does knowing this shape our ministry?<br>

Tozer states, “What comes into our minds when we think about God is the most important thing about us.” He goes on to say, “Were we able to extract from any man a complete answer to the question, ‘What comes into your mind when you think about God?’ we might predict with certainty the spiritual nature of that man.” (pg. 2) It is with these thoughts in mind that we seek to delve into this module.<br>

          <div class="col-md-10">Isn’t it interesting that while the Bible and Christ are increasingly lowered in their value and worth throughout the world, mankind is increasingly exulted? Were we made to be exulted? As both image bearers and sinners, what is our true condition? What does it mean to be made in the image of God, yet deeply fallen? As you work through this module, you will deal with these questions and more. It is our prayer that you grow in your understanding of yourself on one hand, and in your amazement at the grace and mercy of our great Savior on the other hand.<br>

Our thoughts run to “functional saviors” (money, performance, etc.) and our conversations turn to everything other than the beautiful Savior. As you work through this module, you will consider afresh who Jesus really is - both in His deity and His humanity. At the end, you’ll be challenged to see a beautifully supreme savior.<br>

What is the role of the parachurch? Is the parachurch even biblical? Are there certain things that have to be present in “church” to be “church”? Is the church’s focus to be to reach the lost?...feed and nurture the sheep?...equip the saints? Is it to be seeker sensitive?... Missional?... emergent?... or emerging? As we dive into this module, we won’t be able to answer all of these questions, but we will consider, at its foundation, the biblical calling of the church.<br>

Not only will the chains of sin and death be broken, but the Lord Jesus Christ will establish his long-promised kingdom and restore all creation. In this module, we will look at “eschatology” - the study of the end times. We will consider the different views of the afterlife. We will also look at the different views of the millennial reign of Christ. And, we will look at those truths that we can be certain of as we cling to the blessed “hope” of His return.<br>

This module gets ultimately to the heart of truly believing and sacrificially proclaiming the glorious gospel.<br>
